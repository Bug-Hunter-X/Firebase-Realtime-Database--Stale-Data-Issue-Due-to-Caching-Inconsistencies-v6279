# Firebase Realtime Database: Stale Data Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to data staleness in Firebase's Realtime Database.  Despite successful server-side updates, the client occasionally retains outdated data due to caching inconsistencies. This bug is difficult to reproduce reliably due to its asynchronous nature and potential race conditions.  The `bug.js` file contains code that exemplifies the problem, while `bugSolution.js` provides a potential solution involving more robust data synchronization strategies.

## Reproducing the Bug

The exact conditions triggering the bug are not fully understood.  It's believed to be related to the interplay between client-side caching and concurrent database updates.  Experiment with multiple clients modifying the same data to increase the likelihood of encountering the issue.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file offers a possible resolution by incorporating more explicit data synchronization mechanisms.  This may involve more frequent data polling, or leveraging specific Firebase features to manage caching more effectively.
